**Thank you very much for giving me such an opportunity. I would appreciate any feedback from you. There is always a way to improve my work and my coding skills.** 


This is a Coding Exercise that is a part of technical test provided by BuildFire.

**Instructions**

This is meant to be completed in no more than 2 hours. If you insist on taking more time, please do not go overboard. You will be eliminated from consideration if you exceed 4 hours.

 

**Goal**

**This coding exercise is meant to see :**
* How well you understand simple task specifications

**Guidelines**

You will be sent a random video with a project to create using nothing but:

* No Frameworks what so ever

**Prep before the test**

* Have your Development Environment ready
* Create a new FREE GitHub (http://github.com) open-source project. Get familiar with Git and GitHub if you are not yet.
* Make sure your repository remains empty until the test begins
* You will use this repository to push your code to during the test
* Make sure you have a good internet connection during the test so that you may use google to search for answers (if you need it) and to commit your code. You also may need it to watch a video with the requirements
* If something comes up during the test that is unclear, make your best guess and move on.â€‹
